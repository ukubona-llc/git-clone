You're rightâ€”creative destruction **should be elegant, not humiliating**. If you're rebuilding Macs over and over for interns, your baseline should be **absolutely known** and **minimal**, like a freshly cleaned surgical tray before the procedure begins.

### âœ… To Check Your Mac Is "Factory Fresh":

You don't need full macOS reinstallation unless you're paranoid (which is sometimes correct). Instead, verify this baseline:

#### 1. **Check if Developer Tools Are Installed**

```bash
xcode-select -p
```

If that returns a path like `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`, **then it's not fresh**. A true factory state **doesn't include CLI tools.**

#### 2. **Check for Homebrew**

```bash
which brew
```

If it returns anything (like `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew`), it's not fresh. Brew should be *absent*.

#### 3. **Check for Git/Python/Node**

Run:

```bash
git --version
python3 --version
node --version
```

A fresh macOS will have **git trigger the install dialog**, and **Python 3 or Node won't be present.**

#### 4. **Check for VSCode**

```bash
ls /Applications | grep -i code
```

Or:

```bash
mdfind "kMDItemDisplayName == 'Visual Studio Code'"
```

No match = clean.

#### 5. **Check for Dotfiles**

```bash
ls -a ~ | grep -E '\.zshrc|\.bash_profile|\.gitconfig|\.npmrc'
```

Fresh installs shouldn't have custom dotfiles unless the user has been poking around.

### ðŸ§¼ How to Simulate "Factory Fresh" Without Nuking macOS

Use a **separate throwaway user account**:

* Create a new user (`System Settings > Users & Groups > Add User`).
* Log in as that user.
* Treat that user as your **intern sandbox**.

That gives you an untouched environment *without the pain* of full reinstalls.

### ðŸ§ª Then Record Your VSCode Setup from Scratch:

Once you confirm itâ€™s clean, document the following:

1. Download & install VSCode manually or via:

   ```bash
   brew install --cask visual-studio-code
   ```
2. Launch it once so the `.vscode` config path initializes.
3. Use CLI:

   ```bash
   code --install-extension ms-python.python
   code --install-extension ms-vscode.cpptools
   code --install-extension your-list.txt
   ```
4. Optionally, symlink settings:

   ```bash
   ln -s /path/to/your/vscode/settings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json
   ```

---

### ðŸ’¡ Opinion: Script It Like a Ritual

Every intern's first day should be the same:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://yourdomain.com/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

This is **not just automation**. Itâ€™s **liturgical onboarding**. Creative destruction should feel like Genesis 1, not a middle-school group project.

Want a clean `creative-destruction.md` or `onboard.sh` scaffolding for the interns? I can write that next.
